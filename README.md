# Terraform-project

## Deploying and Managing AWS resources by using TERRAFROM

The project involves using Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to automate the deployment and management of scalable and secure AWS cloud infrastructure. This setup supports a multi-tier architecture, including VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, security groups, AWS cli, Jenkins, and Docker while allowing for version control, reuse, and easy modifications to the infrastructure.
